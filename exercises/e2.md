# Exercise 2: Modify the workflow in an editor

> [!TIP]
> Learn about workflow syntax for GitHub Actions from [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

The workflow from the template you applied to your repository is fully defined in the `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` file. Any changes to the workflow will be done by modifying this file.

There are many ways to do it:

- You can edit the file directly in GitHub using [a dedicated editor](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/new-workflow-editor-for-github-actions/).
- You can use the GitHub's [web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor).
- You can edit the file locally in your text editor of choice.

In this workshop, you will learn to use Visual Studio Code For development of GitHub Actions workflows.

## Step 1: Clone the repository

To edit the workflow file in a local text editor, you first have to [make a local clone of the repository](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_clone-a-repository-locally).

1. Open a new Visual Studio Code window.
2. Open the **Source control** view.

3. Click on the **Clone repository** button.

4. Click the **Clone from GitHub** option in the menu which appears.

5. If you aren't signed in to GitHub inside Visual Studio Code, you will need to **Allow** it to sign in.

6. The authorization will take place in your browser. You will need to select the user to sign in with.

7. And finally **Open Visual Studio Code** via the redirect link.

8. Once You are signed in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code, you can select your workshop repository to clone. Type a part of its name into the text box to find the repository faster.

9. A file system dialog will open to **Choose a folder to clone into**. Click the **Select as Repository Destination** button to confirm your choice.

10. Click **Open** to open the folder with the cloned repository in your current Visual Studio Code window.

## Step 2: Add manual trigger for the workflow

With the current configuration, the only way to trigger the workflow is by pushing a commit to the `main` branch or by pushing a commit to a branch with a pull request targeting the `main` branch. It's often useful to be able to [trigger a workflow manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow). Let's add such a trigger to our workflow.

1. Open the `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml` file from the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Add `workflow_dispatch` to the list of triggers and save the file:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: ["main"]
     pull_request:
       branches: ["main"]
     workflow_dispatch:
   ```
3. Open the **Source control** view in Visual Studio Code to commit the change. You can see the file you modified in the list of **Changes**.

4. Click on the `+` button next to the file to **Stage Changes**.

5. Add a commit message and click the **Commit** button.

   ![Image 5](images/e2-s2-i5.png)

6. Click the **Sync Changes** button to push the commit to the remote repository.

7. Click **Ok** to confirm the action.

## Step 3: View and trigger a workflow run inside Visual Studio Code

With [GitHub Actions for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) extension installed, you can view the workflow and their logs without ever leaving Visual Studio Code.

1. Open the **GitHub Actions** view in Visual Studio Code.

   ![Image 1](images/e2-s3-i1.png)

2. If the extension is not yet signed in to GitHub, click the **Sign in to GitHub** button.

   ![Image 2](images/e2-s3-i2.png)

3. Click the **Allow** button in the dialog box to open the authorization page in your browser. Follow the same steps as when signing in with the GitHub extension.

   ![Image 3](images/e2-s3-i3.png)

4. Once you are signed in to GitHub with the extension, you should see two build of the .NET workflow on your current branch. If you only see one, click the **Refresh current branch** button.

5. Expand the .NET #2 workflow run node in the tree view to see the job and its steps.

   ![Image 5](images/e2-s3-i5.png)

6. Click the **View job logs** button to open the logs in the editor. All the log entries for a job are shown as a single plain text file without any grouping by steps. You can notice the `##[group]` and `##[endgroup]` entries in the file, which are used by the web-based log viewer to group the entries.

7. To trigger a new workflow run manually (now that you have added a manual trigger), click the "right arrow play" button for the .NET workflow.

   ![Image 7](images/e2-s3-i7.png)

8. Press **Enter** to confirm triggering the workflow on the `main` branch.

   ![Image 8](images/e2-s3-i8.png)

9. To do the same from the GitHub web page of your repository, navigate to the **Actions** page, click on the **.NET** workflow in the sidebar, open the **Run workflow** dropdown and click on the **Run workflow** button.
